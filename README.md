## 👋 Hi! 

I’m Daniel P. Hall Riggins, MD, a Pediatric Preventive Medicine Fellow at [Cook County Health](https://cookcountyhealth.org/education-research/residency-programs/public-health-preventive-medicine/)/[Northwestern University](https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/sites/cehs/our-programs/program-in-public-health/index.html) in Chicago, IL. I use my skills in R coding, data wrangling, statistical modeling, and geospatial analysis to serve the public good.

## 🚀 Central Motivating Goal

One of the most transformative things we can do for equity in global health is transfer control and [stewardship of the land](https://www.communitystewardshipofland.org/) to local communities. What they choose to do with that land should be their autonomous decision, but some of my favorite uses are [forming a CLT](https://groundedsolutions.org/strengthening-neighborhoods/community-land-trusts) for affordable housing, [incorporating green infrastructure](https://www.epa.gov/green-infrastructure/what-green-infrastructure) to mitigate the hazards of climate change, [cultivating crops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_agriculture) for healthy food, or [conserving ecosystems](https://www.ecohealthalliance.org/about) to curb the spread of infectious disease. 

## 🙋🏻 My Role

### ➡️ Direct Service

I care for families in pediatric primary care. Their stories and my personal experiences with them inform everything else I do.

I am currently exploring career options after I finish my fellowship in Summer 2023. I would love to collaborate on a project if you share in my interests above or learn from you if you have skills in Bayesian statistics, causal analysis, or earth observation. Cheers!</p>


- 👀 I’m interested in the health implications of societal investments in things like housing and green infrastructure. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: 
    - The Bayesian approach to statistics in [Statistical Rethinking](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) 
    - Systematic approaches to analysis with the [Tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/) and [easystats](https://easystats.github.io/easystats/) frameworks
    - Maintaining efficient, reproducible workflows with [Targets](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/)
    - Upcoming courses at NU in:
        - Network analysis
        - Causal inference
- 💞️ Let me know if you're interested in collaborating on:
    - Understanding the local epidemiology of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome in Chicago, IL 
    - Evaluating a model for medical respite care and its policy implications
    - Developing processes to ease the placement process for people seeking substance use recovery homes

Quick sidenote about my handle (@andtheWings): An old reference to when I attained temporary hero status at a college Superbowl party for cooking up chicken wings during half-time. My friends dubbed me **Riggins and the Wings** and many continued using it as a nickname throughout my undergraduate years.

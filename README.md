- 👋 Hi, I’m Daniel P. Hall Riggins (@andtheWings) 
    - My username is a reference to when I attained temporary hero status at a college Superbowl party for cooking up chicken wings during half-time. Then my teammates decided the wings were undercooked. My high regard on the team sank back to normal, but the nickname Riggins and the Wings stuck. (And to my defense, this was before you could stream games on your phone and I wanted to see how it ended). 
- 👀 I’m interested in the health implications of societal investments in things like housing and green infrastructure. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: 
    - The Bayesian approach to statistics in [Statistical Rethinking](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) 
    - Systematic approaches to analysis with the [Tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/) and [easystats](https://easystats.github.io/easystats/) frameworks
    - Maintaining efficient, reproducible workflows with [Targets](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/)
    - Upcoming courses at NU in:
        - Network analysis
        - Causal inference
- 💞️ Let me know if you're interested in collaborating on:
    - Understanding the local epidemiology of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome in Chicago, IL 
    - Evaluating a model for medical respite care and its policy implications
    - Developing processes to ease the placement process for people seeking substance use recovery homes
- 📫 How to reach me
